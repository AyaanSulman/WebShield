- **zxcvbn** - Password strength estimation
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests

### Backend
- **Flask** - Python web framework
- **Flask-CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing
- **Requests** - HTTP library for API calls
- **HaveIBeenPwned API** - Breach and password checking

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Start both servers** (backend on port 5000, frontend on port 3000)
2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Enter your email and password** in the security assessment form
4. **Review the results**:
   - Email breach status
   - Password strength analysis
   - Browser fingerprint security score
   - Personalized security recommendations

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/check-security`
Analyzes email and password security.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "userpassword"
}
```

## Security Features

### Privacy Protection
- Passwords are never stored or logged
- Email addresses are only used for breach checking
- All data processing happens locally or through secure APIs
- No personal data is retained after analysis

### Browser Fingerprinting Detection
- Detects tracking capabilities
- Identifies security-relevant browser features
- Provides recommendations for privacy enhancement

### Password Security
- Real-time strength analysis
- Breach database checking (using k-anonymity)
- Detailed feedback and improvement suggestions

## Customization

### Styling
The app uses a custom Tailwind CSS configuration with retro/cyberpunk colors:
- `retro-pink`, `retro-purple`, `retro-blue`, `retro-cyan`
